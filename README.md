# Fake Button Challenge

Interacts with heroku server to create users for a candidate, list the users, and supply trasfers.



### Prerequisites

Android Studio or an Android Device to run the project
```


### Function and Design Decisions

I created one candidate "Josh" to base my app upon. You're able to add as many users as you'd like with this candidate.
The app will continue to update and show user's for "Josh" since I hardcoded that one candidate in. It was my assumption that 
making multiple candidates wasn't necessary.

You can also create transfers to users with the Josh candidate and the app will give Toast message
signifying whether the transfer was successful or not.

Lastly I didn't include a user balance as I didn't see a balance field in the user Json entity
```
